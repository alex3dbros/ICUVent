This project is opensource and there are no guarantees given that this device 
will perform the actions that it's needed to be. Please use it with care and 
under the surveilance of professionals.



Project Structure:

Inside 3DModels folder you have the solidworks 2019 and STL files 
Inside programming you will have the programming code used to control the device.
We started with Arduino Nano, stepper Driver and nema 23 motor.

You have the schematics of the circuit attached as well.


Parts used that must be purchased:

Some info about how I built it:

I 3D printed parts and cut at the CNC the larger ones.
Here's a video with the machine functional

All the best!
